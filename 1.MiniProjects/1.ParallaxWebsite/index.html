              <h2 class="secHeading">Adventure Time</h2>
              <p class="text">  Adventures are some of the moments in life, which makes our heart pump faster and gives us the feeling of being alive and full. It is an exciting experience very different from our normal daily routine. The adventure also brings with it a certain amount of risk. It brings thrill with it, and we can feel the wind rushing. Some people love adventures and live for them. Others use it as a means of escape from their normal lives. Whatever be the reason, adventure makes people feel great about being able to live those moments.
                 <br><br>
                 Activities like horse riding, bungee jumping, river rafting, parasailing, skiing, kayaking, paragliding, mountain climbing, freefalls etc. are called adventure activities

            </div>
            <p class="text"> Cycling is the best way to get in shape, enjoy the outdoors, and have fun while youâ€™re doing it.  Unfortunately, many people think bicycles are for kids and often overlook the positive physical and psychological health benefits of cycling.  If you ride bike for thirty minutes every day, you would burn eleven pounds of fat in a year, build lean muscle, boost your metabolism, and dramatically decrease your chances of acquiring heart disease.
                <br><br>
                A bicycle is a useful vehicle that helps us reach a destination without polluting the environment.

        <h2 class="desc">Surfing</h2>
</div>
<p class="text"> Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore.
    <br><br>
    Surfing got its name from the renowned artist John Webber, who spotted native Hawaiians in the Bay of Kealakekua doing such activity.
